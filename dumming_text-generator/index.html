'Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
 industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
 since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
 scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
 centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
 unchanged.' 'It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
 sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
 publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
 It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
 content of a page when looking at its layout.' 'The point of using Lorem Ipsum
 is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
 using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
 Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem
 Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
 uncover many web sites still in their infancy.' Various versions have evolved
over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected
humour and the like).
'Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
 roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000
 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College
 in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
 from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
 classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.' Lorem Ipsum comes
from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The
Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
in section 1.10.32.
'The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced
below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus
Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original
form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
Rackham.'
«'But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing of a pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.' Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.»
The Lorem ipum filling text is used by graphic designers, programmers and printers with the aim of occupying the spaces of a website, an advertising product or an editorial production whose final text is not yet ready.

This expedient serves to get an idea of the finished product that will soon be printed or disseminated via digital channels.

In order to have a result that is more in keeping with the final result, the graphic designers, designers or typographers report the Lorem ipsum text in respect of two fundamental aspects, namely readability and editorial requirements.

The choice of font and font size with which Lorem ipsum is reproduced answers to specific needs that go beyond the simple and simple filling of spaces dedicated to accepting real texts and allowing to have hands an advertising/publishing product, both web and paper, true to reality.

Its nonsense allows the eye to focus only on the graphic layout objectively evaluating the stylistic choices of a project, so it is installed on many graphic programs on many software platforms of personal publishing and content management system.
